**Disclaimer**: This plugin is no longer maintained. I found that [fzf-tab](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab) serves the purpose of Git completions much better. 

## Installation

Make sure you have [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed. Then use the plugin manager of your choice to install fzf-git.

### Zplug

```
zplug "hschne/fzf-git"
```

### Antigen 

```
antigen bundle hschne/fzf-git
```

### Oh my Zsh

```
 git clone https://github.com/hschne/fzf-git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/fzf-git
```

## Usage

This plugin simply enables auto-completion of git commands using the `**` trigger. For example, type

```
git checkout **<TAB>
```

to get a fuzzy-searchable list of branches. Currently only `git checkout` and its aliases (`git co`, `gco`, `g checkout`, `g co`) are supported.
